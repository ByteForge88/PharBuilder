# Description
I made this so you can compile BetterAltay plugins with ease!

# Usage
1. Drop the build.php inside your plugin folder\n(NOT the server plugins folder but inside the actual plugins folder)
2. Go into your terminal and run the command 'php -d phar.readonly=0 build.php'
3. Go back into the plugins folder and the .phar should appear
